# Upload Solution Summary

## Problem
Files were automatically starting to upload when added to the queue, instead of waiting for the user to click "Start Upload".

## Solution
Created a clean `useUpload` composable that:
1. Manages all upload state in a shared ref outside the function (session-based)
2. Provides a clean API with `startUpload()`, `pauseUpload()`, and `stopUpload()` functions
3. Removes all automatic triggers - uploads ONLY start when explicitly called

## Key Changes

### 1. New `useUpload` Composable (`packages/core/src/composables/useUpload.ts`)
- Shared state outside the function for cross-component access
- Clean API for upload management
- No automatic watchers or triggers
- Exports all necessary state and functions

### 2. Removed Old Implementation
- Deleted `packages/core/src/stores/upload.ts` 
- Deleted `packages/core/src/composables/useUploadWorker.ts`
- Removed all event-based communication

### 3. Updated Components
- **AdminLayout**: Simply initializes `useUpload` with the upload service
- **UploadView**: Uses `useUpload()` to get queue management functions
- **TStatusBar**: Uses `useUpload()` to display upload status and controls

## Usage

```typescript
// Initialize once with the service (in AdminLayout)
useUpload(uploadService, toastService)

// Use anywhere else without parameters
const { 
  queue,
  addToQueue,
  removeFromQueue,
  startUpload,
  clearSuccessful,
  clearAll,
  isUploading,
  pendingItems,
  successItems
} = useUpload()
```

## Benefits
1. **Simple and clean** - No complex event systems or store management
2. **Explicit control** - Uploads only start when `startUpload()` is called
3. **Shared state** - All components see the same upload queue
4. **Session-based** - State is cleared on page refresh (as intended)
